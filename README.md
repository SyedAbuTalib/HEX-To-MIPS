# HEX-To-MIPS
In order to make comp arch questions more manageable.
Most online ones kinda suck. This one is supposed to take in multiple lines, and hopefully pastes it into a file.

# How to Run
Takes time to convert? Just run Main.java

# How input is set up
Default is HEX.

First question is HEX or Binary.

if 'Yes' is inputted, then Binary. Anything else will be HEX.

Input the HEX as '000ca021'.

Input the Binary as '000...000' (of length 32).
